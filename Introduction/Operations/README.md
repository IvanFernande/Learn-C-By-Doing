# Operators

This folder showcases various operators in C, including arithmetic, assignment, bitwise, and logical operators. Each code example demonstrates the use and behavior of these operators in different scenarios.

## Code Descriptions

1. **`arithmetic.c`**
   - Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.
   - Includes an example of type casting to achieve accurate division.
   - **Key Concept:** Performing arithmetic calculations and understanding type casting.

2. **`assignment.c`**
   - Shows the use of compound assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.
   - Highlights how these operators simplify and combine assignment and arithmetic.
   - **Key Concept:** Using compound assignment operators for concise code.

3. **`bit_to_bit.c`**
   - Demonstrates bitwise operations: AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), left shift (`<<`), and right shift (`>>`).
   - Includes examples with unsigned integers to show how each operation manipulates individual bits.
   - **Key Concept:** Understanding bitwise operations and their practical uses.

4. **`logic.c`**
   - Uses logical operators: AND (`&&`) and OR (`||`) to evaluate conditions in `if` statements.
   - Demonstrates scenarios where logical operators are useful for combining conditions.
   - **Key Concept:** Combining conditions in decision-making.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run these programs:
1. Use the GCC compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc file_name.c -o output_name
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output_name
   ```

## How to Use

- Run each example to observe the behavior of different operators.
- Modify the input values or conditions to test various scenarios and understand the output.
- Pay attention to the `bit_to_bit.c` example to see how bit-level manipulations work.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply arithmetic, assignment, bitwise, and logical operators.
- Learn how to use compound assignment operators to simplify code.
- Explore the practical uses of bitwise operations in low-level programming.
- Combine logical conditions for efficient decision-making in programs.
