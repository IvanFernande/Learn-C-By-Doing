# Basics

This folder contains foundational examples of control structures in C programming. Each code snippet focuses on a specific structure or concept commonly used in beginner-level programming.

## Code Descriptions

1. **`for_loop_example.c`**
   - Demonstrates the usage of a `for` loop.
   - Prints numbers from 1 to 5 sequentially.
   - **Key Concept:** Iterative looping using `for`.

2. **`if_else_example.c`**
   - Shows how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` for decision-making.
   - Determines whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - **Key Concept:** Conditional branching.

3. **`while_and_do_while.c`**
   - Explores `while` and `do-while` loops.
   - Uses a counter to demonstrate both types of loops.
   - **Key Concept:** Looping with conditions.

4. **`switch_case_example.c`**
   - Demonstrates the use of a `switch` statement for multi-case branching.
   - Selects an option based on a predefined variable.
   - **Key Concept:** Efficient handling of multiple conditions.

5. **`prime_numbers.c`**
   - A program to calculate and print prime numbers up to a user-defined value.
   - Utilizes nested loops to check divisibility.
   - **Key Concept:** Combining loops and conditional logic for problem-solving.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run these programs:
1. Use the GCC compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc file_name.c -o output_name
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output_name
   ```

## How to use
- Explore each file to understand the control structure in action.
- Modify the code to test different scenarios or input values.
- Use comments to note your observations and learnings.
