# Functions

This folder contains examples of using functions in C to demonstrate their different types and applications, including value/reference parameters and recursion.

## Code Descriptions

1. **`simple_declaration.c`**
   - Demonstrates the definition and use of a function that adds two integers.
   - Highlights how to declare and define functions separately.
   - **Key Concept:** Basic function structure, declaration, and usage.

2. **`parameters.c`**
   - Explores passing parameters by value and by reference.
   - Shows how passing by value does not affect the original variable, while passing by reference allows modification.
   - **Key Concept:** Differences between passing by value and reference.

3. **`recursive.c`**
   - Implements a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   - Highlights the base case and recursive call mechanism.
   - **Key Concept:** Understanding recursion and its use cases.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run these programs:
1. Compile using the GCC compiler:
   gcc file_name.c -o output_name
2. Execute the program:
   ./output_name

## How to Use

- Review the examples to understand how functions work in C.
- Test the `parameters.c` example to observe the difference between modifying variables by value and by reference.
- Modify the `recursive.c` example to calculate factorials of different numbers or explore recursion limits.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to define and call functions in C.
- Understand the difference between passing arguments by value and reference.
- Explore recursion and its application in problem-solving.
